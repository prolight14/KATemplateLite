# Khan Academy template lite

A version of the Khan Academy processing js project template with no support for loading images or sounds.

# How to use

Copy your Khan Academy project's code into ./js/index.js and make sure you're not using any sound or images from Khan Academy.


Note: `get` and `image` will still work just not `getImage`, `getSound`, or `playSound`
If your project still uses these methods it'll still load just fine you just won't be able to see or hear any images or sounds.
